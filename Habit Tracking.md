**Why?** 
Habits build primarily through repetition, not time or perfection $\Rightarrow$ repetition builds up and tops everything!


Habit tracking is a good way to monitor yourself and to measure your progress.
  
  - Use templates from web page.
  - Always carry it with you.
  - Be careful not to measure the wrong thing (e.g., # of hours listened to, or poor metric).
  - Find a good measure (e.g., good KPI) is important.

- Never miss twice!
- Donâ€™t break the chain!

## Hardcore modus:

Accountability partner with whom you make a contract signed by one additional person.

Content:
-  targets & goals (KPI)
- Punishments if goals are not met
- Signing the contract will force you to follow your goals
- Knowing that someone is watching is a strong motivator.
