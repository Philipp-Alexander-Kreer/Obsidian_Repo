Data posses some representation in form of a graph e.g. [[Design new Molecules]].
Problem: Graph $\to$ Property (e.g., Toxicity, Drug Efficacy).

Over-smoothing and over-squashing are the difficult problems to mitigate $\to$ enhance with geometric information. 


**Example:** Decide if two graphs are isomorphic to each other with Massage Passage Paradigm 

Classical Weisfeiler-Lehman Algorithm is identical to standard model (What is the standard model)?

Enhance with geometric characterization e.g. local curvature profiles. Take curvature analogs of smooth curvature on discrete spaces, e.g. Ricci curvature $\to$  Ollivier-Ricci curvature or Forman curvature.

Associate a procedure that adds or removes connections based on curvature.
