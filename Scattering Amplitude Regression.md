## [[Geometric Algebra Transformer (GAT)]]

- Learns faster than Transformers
- Performs better if more external legs are present
- Divergences were cut away
- Known symmetries $\Rightarrow$ Learn the ampliude

## Gaussian Processes

I have a rough idea of the amplitude $\Rightarrow$ Model learns the details


**Open Questions:** 

- Can I tackle divergences by  approximating  the amplitude around the diverged point?
- Can I regularize divergences somehow e.g. multiplying with a suitable polynomial?
- Test on maximally helicity-violating amplitude.
- GP approach? Have a rough idea of the amplitude before the test.

GAT = know the symmetries => lets learn the amplitude.

- Qualcomm is an industry company that does a lot of research on particle physics => get in touch with Johann Blech.
