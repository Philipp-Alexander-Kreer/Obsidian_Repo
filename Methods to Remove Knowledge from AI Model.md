- **Clean data:** Prevent the model from learning undesired behavior in the first place.
- **Compress model:** Is that really useful?
- **Meta learning:** Not only train to perform good on a specific task but also perform bad on others.
- **Interpret model and change its behavior:** (e.g., mechanism interpretation)
