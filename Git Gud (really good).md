**Habits + Deliberate practice = Mastery.**

- Combine two field in which you are good to create something new -> outperform everyone because you are alone
- genes tell us what to focus on -> find something suitable for you to get extremely good
- Find challenges at the edge of your capability, not too difficult, not too easy -> Flow state
- Every habit will lose its attraction at some point and you have to push through the boredom.
- Optimal ratio between winning/losing is ca. 50/50.
- Stick to the schedule
