**Observations** 
- Tightly connected to weight loss over training time.
- Beyond grokking, the test loss drops significantly.

## Simple Model:

Network  = Memorization Circuit + Generalization Circuit (oversimplified)

The **weight decay** incentives the model to generalize, to be more efficient, but it only shows up after some time $t$.

## A theory of generalization
