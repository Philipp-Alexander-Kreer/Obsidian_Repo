Tow types of roles:
	- Connectors
	- Amplifiers

Connectors: strong conceptual thinkers with good experimental background, 

Examples:
1. Paul Christiano
2. Buck Shlegeris 
3. Evan Hubinger
4. Alex Turner Still

Academia ranks Connectors higher than scalling labs and small orgs

 Amplifiers:  good enough researchers but really shine as communicators (org managers etc) 
 
  If I want to be a connector I must face the public confrontation stage (publishing!) 



### Ideas

Consider shifting to AI governance.

1. Technical AI Alignment is very difficult and full of people
2. Governance is difficult but lack of people with technical background

If you want to get into Google Deep Mind you have to anticipate tendencies + practical experience e.g. RLHF

Positions grow but number of applicants grows faster

Independent research= good path to burn out
