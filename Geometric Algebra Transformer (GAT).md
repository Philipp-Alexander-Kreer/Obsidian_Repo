Geometric: Problem's underlying geometry/symmetry are described by a symmetry group, e.g., $E(3), SO(3),$ etc.

Transformer: Architecture builds on attention mechanism like Transformer


**Key idea:**  Elements of symmetry group are the fundamental building blocks in ever layer (equivarient network)
