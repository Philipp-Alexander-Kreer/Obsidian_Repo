## Things to do during presentations

- Take time for speaking (also good for [[Dating]])
- Keep the time constraints
- Be expressive  (also good for [[Dating]])
- Body language: stay calm/ don't jump around (also good for [[Dating]])
- Explain diagrams
- Explain experimental setup

## Things to avoid
- Never as if you can go over time, just do it if you really need to.
- Don’t discriminate other talks
- Don’t make yourself unlikable
- Nod if someone shows you the rest time

## Don't say
- Thank you for the invitation and giving me the possibility to speak -> Thank you for organizing this amazing conference, blah blah 
- Thank you for the invitation it is an honor to speak -> I am glad that so many smart people are in the audience
- I'll try to be quick
- My supervisor -> collaborator
-  I think these things are important because of XYZ -> Make it self evident

## Other things
- Microphone in the hand looks stupid. 
- Skip personal stories like “I’ll give a talk on this (Noone cares)
