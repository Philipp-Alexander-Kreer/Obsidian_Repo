Network which manifest the geometric properties of a model by manifesting its group structure.

**Mathematical Definition**
[[Equivariant Function]]

**Model Structure:**
- Equivariant layers $\to$  keeps symmetry in tact.
- Activation function $\to$  needs to satisfy some conditions (e.g., ReLU )
- Local pooling
- Output layer: global pooling $\to$ kind of average.

**Trade-Off consideration:** Generalization vs Train ability
- How expensive is it to train? (More complicated model)
- How many samples do I need (Typically less)

**Example:**
- [[Geometric Algebra Transformer (GAT)]]
