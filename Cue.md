- Many cues become so invisible that we don't notice them unless someone is triggering you/telling you.
- Once a habit becomes automatic, we stop paying attention to it.
- Time & Location strong cues
- Context acts as cue
- Environment
- Social norms

$\Rightarrow$ All change starts with awareness

## Raise Awareness
- Point out and speak actions to increase awareness
- Write [[Scorecard]] 

Create new cues:
- [[Habit Stacking]] 
- Specific times and places for every habit.
- Set new context, place or environment.
- Remove unwanted cues
- [[The Power of Friction]]
- Change/join group where desired habit is the norm rather than the exception.
- Find a person who sticks with his habit and copy it.
- Ignore the group.
- Introduce ritual


**Self control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one!**
