Success = product of daily habits (not once-in-a-lifetime efforts).

Improve 1% each day for one year  $\Rightarrow$  37 times better at the end. Also works for the opposite. 

Progress is exponential  $\Rightarrow$ Outcomes are delayed.

Breaking through the Plateau of Latent Potential is what people call overnight success.
  - It is like an ice cube; I heat it from -28°C, -20°C, -10°C, -5°C, etc. until 0°C. It starts melting; 0°C is the plateau I must surpass.

- What is decisive for success are the systems, not the goals.
- 
  - **My Goal:** Find a girlfriend I love.
  - **System:** 
    - How do I approach people?
    - How do I show myself?
    - What is the impression of others from me?
    - Do I ask people what do they do? etc.

- A good system will lead to success (of some form) even without a specified goal.
- A good goal without a system will probably not achieve success.
